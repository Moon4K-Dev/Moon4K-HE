# Adding Songs to Moon4K

* Adding songs to Moon4K is fairly simple! You have two ways to download them.
* You can either manually download them from the [github repo that holds the maps/songs](https://github.com/Moon4K-Dev/Moon4K-OnlineMaps) or, you can use the in-game downloader!

* If you manually download a song just extract the chart's zip file into ```YOUR_MOON4K_DIRECTORY/assets/charts``` and you're done!
* If you use the in-game downloader all you have to do is click on a song that you want to download and then press enter! The game automatically handles downloading it and extracting it to the charts directory!
