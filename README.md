# Moon4K - Hamburger Engine Port - Custom Server Branch

* Testing a hypothetical custom server for Moon4K (mainly for acc and profile shit, I am NOT planning on doing multiplayer as of right now!)

* Also I will not be making a repo for Yotsuki (the server for Moon4K) until it's in a stage of development where it works at least half way (basically no repo until profile stuff)

* 4-key rhythm game originally made by basically three people

* But now remade in C++.
