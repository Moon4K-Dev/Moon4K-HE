# NOTICE

This is gonna be rewritten again. Why? Mainly because HamburgerEngine is extremely unoptimized and my other engine KoiArt Framework is. I will be using that engine instead of HamburgerEngine in the future. When will the rewrite start development? I don't know yet, I'm currently focusing on porting SlipKnot from Unity to KAF so yea.
